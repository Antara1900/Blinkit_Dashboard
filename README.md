-Total Sales by Outlet Types shows Supermarket Type1 has $362.6K in sales compared to only $82.2K for Grocery Stores.
-Sales by Item Type reveals Snacks, Fruits, and Household items are the top 3 in sales.
## Final Conclusion:
To drive growth, Blinkit should focus on expanding Small-sized outlets in Tier 2 cities, as they generate the highest sales. Investing in Supermarket Type1 format and promoting high-performing categories like Snacks, Fruits, and Household items can further boost revenue. Additionally, optimizing inventory for Regular fat content products (which dominate sales) can enhance customer satisfaction and repeat purchases.
